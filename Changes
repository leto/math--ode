-----------------------------------
    - Added the $o->format() method which allows setting the value format to
      something other than the default of %.12f. It can also be specified
      via the format argument at during object creation.
      Thanks to Wilhelm Braunschober for the suggestion

-----------------------------------
    - Added the $o->file() method which was documented but never existed
      Thanks to Wilhelm Braunschober for reporting

0.05 Sun Mar 02 09:18:24 EST 2008 
------------------------------------
    - fixed POD errors
    - new behavior is to print to STDOUT if file => undef and keep_values => 0.
        This could be useful if you want to filter/modify the data before plotting.

        Something like: ./solve_my_ode.pl | find_interesting_values.pl > data; gnuplot data
    


0.04 Fri Feb 29 22:54:30 EST 2008 
-------------------------------------
	- ported to Module::Build 
	- ported tests to Test::More and added some rigorous tests which
      verify given analytic solutions at various step sizes

	- one can now access computed values with $o->values_at() which 
	  returns an array of values at a given point 
	- default behavior changes to retain values internally instead of printing to STDOUT 
	  if no { file => $foo } attribute was given
	- one can turn off saving computing values in memory with keep_values = 0 in the
	  arguments to init like 

	  my $ode = new Math::ODE ( file => 'data', keep_values => 0, etc... );

	  This may be useful if you have a fine mesh size and/or long batch jobs.

	- $o->evolve() now returns true on success and undefined on numerical error
    - fixed off-by-one bug in _store_values
    - added $o->max_error([ $subref1, $subref2 ] ) to calculate maximum error from a
        Math::ODE object and an analytic solution, given as an array ref of code refs
    - t/values_at.t
